<section class="about-me">
  <p>My love for creative design led me into taking software development.<br>
    Before Thinkful, I had already become a UX/UI designer. While researching <br>
    different career paths, it helped me realized that a person that could both <br>
    design and code would be a great asset to any company. </p>
  <br>
  <p>After some courses on my own I found the field fascinating. So now I'm <br>
    taking on the challenge on becoming an engineer in the industry.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I am actively looking for new opportunities to work with new teams and <br>
    create great things that people can enjoy using. Feel free to reach out! I'm <br>
    excited to create great things.</p>
